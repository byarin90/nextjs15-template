# Password Reset Flow Improvements

This document explains the changes made to improve the password reset functionality in the Next.js application.

## Problem Overview

The main issue was that tokens were not being properly passed through the authentication flow, leading to failures in the password reset process. This happened because:

1. NextAuth.js redirects during the authentication process, which can cause tokens to be lost
2. The callback URL mechanism wasn't properly preserving the token
3. There was no fallback mechanism for token retrieval

## Solution Approach

We've implemented a multi-layered approach to ensure that password reset tokens are preserved throughout the authentication flow:

### 1. Token Handling in `auth.ts`

- Enhanced the `sendVerificationRequest` function to properly extract and manage tokens
- Added extensive logging to help debug token-related issues
- Implemented token preservation in callback URLs

### 2. Middleware for Token Preservation

- Created a middleware that intercepts auth-related requests
- Extracts tokens from various sources (URL, callbackUrl, headers)
- Ensures tokens are properly passed through redirects

### 3. Client-Side Token Extraction

- Added a `TokenScript` component that runs on the client side
- Extracts tokens from URL parameters, hash fragments, and headers
- Stores tokens in both localStorage and sessionStorage for persistence

### 4. Enhanced Token Retrieval Logic

- Updated the reset-password page to check for tokens in multiple locations
- Implemented a fallback mechanism to retrieve tokens from local storage
- Added extensive logging to track the token flow

## Implementation Details

### Key Files Modified:

1. `auth.ts` - Enhanced the authentication configuration and token handling
2. `middleware.ts` - Added middleware to intercept auth requests and preserve tokens
3. `app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx` - Improved token extraction and error handling
4. `app/auth/reset-password/token-script.tsx` - Added client-side token handling
5. `app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts` - Updated API endpoint to accept tokens from headers

### Token Preservation Strategy:

1. **Original Email Link**: Token is included in the initial reset password URL
2. **Auth Flow**: Middleware ensures token is preserved in callback URLs during redirects
3. **Client Storage**: Tokens are stored in localStorage/sessionStorage as a fallback
4. **Hash Fragment**: Tokens in URL hash fragments are extracted and preserved
5. **Request Headers**: Added token extraction from request headers

### Logging Enhancements:

- Added comprehensive logging throughout the authentication flow
- Log entry points and token values at each step
- Capture token storage and retrieval attempts

## Testing and Verification

To verify the password reset flow works properly:

1. Request a password reset from the login page
2. Check email for the reset link
3. Click the link and complete the authentication flow
4. Verify token is correctly passed to the reset password page
5. Complete the password reset process

Look for log entries with "RESET PASSWORD" prefix to track the flow.

## Further Improvements

Some potential future improvements:

1. Add server-side token validation before showing the reset form
2. Implement rate limiting for password reset requests
3. Add more user-friendly error messages
4. Enhance the email template for password reset requests

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check browser console logs for token-related messages
2. Verify that the token is being correctly stored in the database
3. Ensure the email contains the correct reset link with token
4. Check middleware logs to confirm token preservation during redirects
